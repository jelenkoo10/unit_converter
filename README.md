# Unit Converter - Solo project on Scrimba Frontend Career Path

A simple imperial/metric unit converter, that converts meters to feet, litres to gallons, kilograms to pounds, and vice versa. It's been made as Solo project on [Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend), and it helped me a lot in the beginning of my frontend journey, as it combines HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge.
